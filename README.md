# State Exam Notes for University of Debrecen Students

- For the useful notes, use the rendered pdf files (auto generated).
- Feel free to update using pull requests (use the markdown files).
- Please try to use and add any images used under the `src/imgs` directory, prevent from using online links and use either `.png` or `.jpg` format to avoid conflicts. 

**Note:** I will try my best to stay up to date with this for the following years, but at some point I might forget about it. In this case, feel free to fork the repo :)
